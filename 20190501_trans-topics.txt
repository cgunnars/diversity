# Trans issues
- Who are trans people
- Trans people face structural discrimination and social discrimination
	*Bathrooms
	*IDs
	*Survey questions
	
	*Harrassment 
	*Misgendering/deadnaming
	Discrimination is frequent, pervasive and obvious

# Organizing along trans issues
- Lots to be done
- Getting "quantitative support" for initiatives is hard 
- Extra effort is required to make trans people feel welcome

# Specific initiatives
- A more inclusive interview weekend
	*This year: 
	Asking about accommodations beforehand 
	Pronoun stickers at graduate student-hosted events
		-Pronoun etiquette for interview weekend hosts
		-Discussed at faculty meeting
		-With Title IX office, put together pronoun explainer
	Diversity panel at interview weekend
		-Women, under-represented minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people
		-In-person questions, anonymous questions
	*Future work:
	Bathrooms list, prayer rooms list, lactation rooms list
	Event planning checklists

# What can be learned
- We win by sticking together
	*Example from speaker session
	We can also imagine aligning with undergrads, with university-wide campaigns 
- Find low-hanging fruit first 
	*Can we start doing things without "permission"?
- Changing people's behaviors changes their beliefs -- not the other way around
	*Example from pronoun stickers
	Inertia can be your friend!
- Graduate students can harness certain forms of power
	*We host interview weekends
	*We run lab websites
	*We make syllabi	

#Future goals
- Power of norms
